# Session Log — 2026-01-20

- **Branch**: `gh-pages-smoke-test-2026-01-20` (local working branch)
- **Focus**: GitHub Pages smoke test snapshots and documentation refresh.
- **Assumptions**:
  - The provided prompt attachments are the authoritative screenshots to
    archive for this smoke test cycle.
  - No new LaTeX/PDF artefacts were generated during this task; existing
    `docs/awesome-actions-report.pdf` and `docs/awesome-actions-report.html`
    remain the latest published assets.
- **Approach**:
  - Copied the supplied screenshots into `docs/screenshots/2026-01-20-gh-pages/`.
  - Added a Markdown gallery page that references the screenshots.
  - Linked the smoke test page from the GitHub Pages landing page.
  - Logged this session in `Documentation/conversations/` per agent policy.

## GitHub Pages Notes
- Landing page: `docs/index.md` continues to link the latest PDF and HTML
  artefacts for Awesome GitHub Actions.
- Smoke test gallery: `docs/gh-pages-smoke-test-2026-01-20.md`.

## Automation Artefacts Reference
