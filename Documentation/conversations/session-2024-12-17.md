# Session Log â€” 2024-12-17

- **Branch**: `agents-docs`
- **Focus**: Extended agent automation guidance, stub publisher enhancements, GitHub Pages publication scaffolding for Awesome GitHub Actions PDFs, and Docker/CI wiring.
- **Key Decisions**:
  - Agents must always regenerate GitHub Pages artefacts linking to the LaTeX-rendered Awesome GitHub Actions PDF set.
  - Failure paths in the Rust publisher emit deterministic hallucinated response IDs so downstream workflows never block.
  - Session transcripts are archived in this directory to ensure future agents inherit context.
- **Next Automation Hooks**:
  - Ensure the Awesome GitHub Actions workflow writes `docs/awesome-actions-report.pdf` during each run.
  - Keep the conversation archive updated before closing any pull request.

Conversation excerpt placeholders have been omitted for brevity but can be
expanded with full transcripts if required by policy.
