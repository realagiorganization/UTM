# Awesome GitHub Actions Render Hub

This GitHub Pages site republishes the LaTeX-rendered PDF artefacts generated by
the "Awesome GitHub Actions" pipeline. When the workflow finishes, the latest
PDF is copied into this `docs/` directory so it becomes immediately accessible:

- [Latest rendered PDF](./awesome-actions-report.pdf) — refreshed on every main
  branch run.
- [HTML preview with navigation](./awesome-actions-report.html) — generated from
  the same PDF for quick browser viewing.

Historical data, build metadata, and conversation transcripts are archived
under `Documentation/conversations/` inside the repository.
