==> Pouring make--4.4.1.arm64_sequoia.bottle.1.tar.gz
==> Caveats
GNU "make" has been installed as "gmake".
If you need to use it as "make", you can add a "gnubin" directory
to your PATH from your bashrc like:

    PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
==> Summary
🍺  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/make/4.4.1: 17 files, 1.3MB
==> Running `brew cleanup make`...
Disable this behaviour by setting `HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP=1`.
Hide these hints with `HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS=1` (see `man brew`).
